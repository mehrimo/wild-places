# wild_places
My Q1 project for Galvanize

My project is called Wild Places - an outdoorsy themed photo searching app. It will allow the user to search for photos using the Unsplash API. The photos will display on the same page.

My MVP is to have the photo search and display correctly. My strech goals are to have a few nature icons below the search field that will search for specific terms when clicked on.
